# Dara language

This is a purely for-fun dynamically-typed language that is a WORK IN PROGRESS.

I'm using it to learn how to write interpreters + compilers for fun. It will use
elements from both Lox (from the book
[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) and Monkey (from the
book [Writing an Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/)), since I am
using these resources to learn.

However as I develop it I hope to diverge from both in order to achieve a
simpler syntax and no semicolons (probably using the same smart placement as Go
uses).

## Usage

If you clone the repo, you can run the _repl_ by compiling to binary, or running
go run main.go. More to come.
